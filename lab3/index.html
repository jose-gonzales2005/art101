			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure & Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with a partner, further create a local file structure on your computer, add index.html files, and upload to the server.</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
					<p>The only huge problem that stood in my way for this lab was unfortunately time constraints. 
					   I didn't have the time that I wanted to properly spend on my website this week, and as while I 
					   completed all the tasks of this lab, it wasn't to a level that I really wanted it to bet at. I spent
					   a fair amount of time editing my silly self-portrait, and I did really enjoy the lab and plan to put more
					   work on the web page later this weekend. I just didn't have the time at the current moment.
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					<p>I realize that the answer I gave for the previous question more or less answers this one. 
					   The only serious problem was me not spending as much time as I could have. 
					</p>
