/*  Setup:
        Start with no money and the turkey healthy.
    Keep Going Until Something Happens: 
        Keep track of how much money you have and how much health the turkey has.
        If you have enough money or the turkey's health runs out, stop.
    During Each Round: 
        Check how much money you have and how healthy the turkey is.
        If you want to punch the turkey, go ahead.
        If you punch, the turkey loses some health, and you earn some money.
    End of the Game
        If you've earned enough money, hooray! You win.
        If the turkey's health drops to zero, you've won as well.
    The End
