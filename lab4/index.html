			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>Create pseudocode and start implementing it into code by putting it in a comment.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them?</p>
				<pre><code><p>Not many problems arose, just a few hiccups while considering the best possible way to word the
					questions. That's about it. I'm not sure where to put these so here are the lists we ended up
					making:
					Task 1: Pseudocoding and Everyday Task
					makeFrenchPressCoffee()
					boilWater()
					measureCoffee()
					grindCoffee()
					preheatFrenchPress()
					addCoffeeToFrenchPress()
					pourWaterOverCoffee()
					stirCoffee()
					startBrewTimer()
					pressPlunger()
					serveCoffee()

					Task 2: Pseudocode a Simple Videogame

					Super Turbo Turkey Puncher 3
					Setup:
					Start with no money and the turkey healthy.
					Keep Going Until Something Happens:
					Keep track of how much money you have and how much health the turkey has.
					If you have enough money or the turkey's health runs out, stop.
					During Each Round:
					Check how much money you have and how healthy the turkey is.
					If you want to punch the turkey, go ahead.
					If you punch, the turkey loses some health, and you earn some money.
					End of the Game
					If you've earned enough money, hooray! You win.
					If the turkey's health drops to zero, you've won as well.
					The End
